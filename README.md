# NumberRecognition
This project is my first difficult project I have attempted and will use a neural network to learn how to guess numbers based on drawings that you make. I used the graphics library of sdl2.
Controls: 'c' to clear your drawring and 'e' to enter your drawing to be guessed as a number.
